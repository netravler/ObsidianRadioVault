## 3-Step Quickstart Guide

  

Welcome to the aviationstack API, Paul!  
This guide should get you started in a matter of seconds - let's dive right in:

## Step 1: Your API Access Key

  

This is your [[API ]]Access Key, your personal key required to authenticate with the API.  
Keep it safe! You can reset it at any time in your [Account Dashboard](https://aviationstack.com/dashboard).

## Step 2: API Endpoints

  

There are several API endpoints to choose from:

-   **Real-Time Flights:** Look up flights in real-time
-   **Historical Flights:** Look up historical flights
-   **Airline Routes:** Look up airline routes
-   **Airports:** Look up global airports
-   **Airlines:** Look up global airlines
-   **Airplanes:** Look up airplanes/aircrafts
-   **Aircraft Types:** Look up aircraft types
-   **Aviation Taxes:** Look up aviation taxes
-   **Cities:** Look up global cities
-   **Countries:** Look up countries

**Base URL:** API requests start out with the following base URL:

https://api.aviationstack.com/v1/

  

**Make API Request:** Let's try making a few simple API requests for the flights, historical flights, routes and other aviation data API endpoints. Take a look at the box below and click the API requests to open them in your browser.

## Make [[aviationstack]] Requestrequired and optional
