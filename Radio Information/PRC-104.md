## Background

> Hughes (Fullerton, California) won a competition to develop an HF radio to replace the [PRC-47](https://www.prc68.com/I/PRC47.shtml).  The Collins PRC-515 was considerably larger and heavier.   
> Frequency coverage is 2.0000 to 29.9999 MHz USB, LSB, CW (up to 300 WPM, i.e. [GRA-71](https://www.prc68.com/I/GRA71.shtml) compatible), FSK/DPSK up to 2400 bps.  It's also known as the Improved High Frequency Radio, IHFR.  Later PRC-104 models included compatibility with the Hughes C-11525/G anti-jam controller (STAJ) which is a frequency hopping system.  
>   
> The PRC-104 is a modular radio that can be configured in a number of different ways:

### DC Power

> Using a BK Precision 1786 lab power supply, on receive the PRC-104 draws 0.16 Amps and on transmit the current varies a lot with voice peaks, maybe 1.6 Amps average, but the peaks might go up to 3 Amps or more.  In CW mode with the key down the current goes slightly over 3 Amps, but this power supply is only rated for 3 Amps.  It seems that a large capacitor on the input would be good to handle the peaks.

### CY-7875 Battery Case

The CY-7875 Battery box holds two each [BA-5590](https://www.prc68.com/I/BA5590.shtml) (or equiv) batteries.  Each is connected to supply 30 Volts, so you can actually run the radio on just one battery, but the talk time will be 1/2 what it could be.  [5590BA Battery Adapter](https://www.prc68.com/I/5590BA.shtml)

> ### Why Two Batteries
> 
> > The 7875 holds two each [BA-5590](https://www.prc68.com/I/BA5590.shtml) batteries, with each BA5590 connected in parallel to provide 30 Volts to the radio.  The front of TM 11-5820-919-12 has a couple of warning pages about the BA-5590 and a statement that it contains a 3.2 Amp slow blow fuse.  It's my understanding that today the BA-5590 has a 2.25 Amp slow blow fuse.  In the specifications table in TM 11-5820-919-12 the Tx current is given as 3.5 Amps at 24.0 Volts.  The 24.0 Volts comes from the battery label showing two 12 Volt sections for a nominal 24 Volts.  So someone may have mistakenly measured the current consumption at 24.0 Volts when the actual battery voltage is 30.  The allowed range of supply voltage is 20.0 to 32.0, consistent with a military vehicle DC supply.  
> >   
> > The current is interesting.  The specified Tx current (3.5 Amps) is slightly greater than the fuse current (3.2 Amps) in the TM, indicating that two batteries are needed to avoid blowing the BA-5590 fuse.  I have used a single BA-5590 without blowing it's fuse, but my Tx times have been very short and so maybe I was lucky with the slow blow aspect of the fuse.  
> >   
> > The rechargeable BB-390 and BB-590 do not have a fuse and are capable of large surge currents so a single one would work fine.  I had a BB-390, but it exploded during charging.  
> >   
> > 9 July 2004 - Test using [prototype Battery Adapter](https://www.prc68.com/I/PRC68COM.shtml#PID) based on two strings of 11 "AA" cells.  When transmitting USB a small number of clicks can be heard in the H-250 handset indicating there are some voice peaks that are pulling the battery below 20 Volts, but when listening on the [NRD-545](https://www.prc68.com/I/NRD545/NRD545.shtml) receiver the voice sounds normal.  So the super caps may be the solution to providing high current peaks.  Will test that shortly.  
> >   
> > Note that when BA-5590 batteries are used, 2 of them are required, and in a similar way if 2 of my prototypes were used, then there would be no low battery warning and the battery life would be greatly extended.  There are a couple of diodes that are a part of the battery charging circuitry in the CY-7875 that combine the two batteries.  Each battery is connected in series for about 30 Volts and then the two physically seperate batteries are paralleled for more current capability.  

This case has a built-in battery charger.  It's input is probably a military vehicle "24 Volt" system.  
The Battery box connector is a MS3102A-10SL-3P and the mating cable connector is probably a MS3106A-10SL-3S.  
Don't know if you can use this to power the set with no batteries installed, need to make up the cable and test it.  
  
Each BA-5590 is 170 WH so two of them provide 340 Watt Hours.  

### CY-7541 Silver Zinc Battery Case

[![CY-7541 w/End
Open](https://www.prc68.com/I/Images/CY7541Opns.jpg)](https://www.prc68.com/I/Images/CY7541Opnb.jpg)The original battery complement was 16 Silver-Zinc 1.86 V cells (30 V) providing 4.8 AH (144 Watt Hr).  
One of the small ends can be removed to give access to the battery compartment.  It's held on by 6 captive screws.  The open end is 2.8" x 1.9" and the compartment is 10 7/8" deep.  
Other battery complements that have appeared on the internet are:  
  

-   20 each C cells at 1.2 Volts & 4.5 AH /cell = 24 Volts & 108 Watt Hours  
    
-   20 each 5/4C cells at   = 24 Volts &  
    
-   40 each 4/3 A cells at 1.2 Volts & 4 AH /cell =  24 Volts & 192 Watt Hours  
    This is a little more difficult since there are two strings in parallel.

These cases are available on the surplus market for about $20 each and can be used to make an external power adapter by removing the vent and routing the battery wires out the resulting hole.  The stock wires only extend about 1 foot from the case, but can be spliced onto longer ones.  

  

### CY-7875 BA-5590 Battery Case  

The "large" CY -7875 is designed to hold two each [BA-5590](https://www.prc68.com/I/BA5590.shtml) LiSO2 batteries or two each BB-390 or BB-590 rechargeable batteries. These batteries were not available when the PRC-104 first came out.  There is a built-in battery charging circuit that can be powered from a military vehicle "24 Volt" source.

### Antennas

There are a number of options.  
  
 The radio has a 3/8-24 female thread. The AB-129 Spring Base and a 10 foot whip, the AT-271, goes above the spring base.  There is a telephone type push to grab ground terminal right next to the antenna socket so a counterpoise can be used.  The [PRC-47](file:///C:/Webdocs_Hosted/I/PRC47.shtml) had the counterpoise wires as part of the base that held the radio up, but on the PRC-104 the counterpoise must be connected.  

The [M-442](file:///C:/Webdocs_Hosted/I/Ant.shtml#M442) could also be used to configure longer whip antennas using [MS-116](https://www.prc68.com/I/RC292.shtml#AB21) antenna elements.

 AT-271

[![AB-129 Spring
Antenna Base](https://www.prc68.com/I/Images/AB129s.jpg)](https://www.prc68.com/I/Images/AB129b.jpg)  

  
AB-129 has female 3/8-24 threads at the top and male 3/8-24 threads at the bottom.  
It's needed to provide some "give" so that the thin walls of the AT-271 antenna don't "fold" when there is a strong wind or other movement.  
  

AT-1011  
  

The [AT-1011](https://www.prc68.com/I/AT1011.shtml) is a vehicle whip that can be configured as a 16 foot or 32 foot whip.  

AS-2259  

The [AS-2259](https://www.prc68.com/I/AS2259.shtml) is an NVIS antenna system origionally designed for the [PRC-47](https://www.prc68.com/I/PRC47.shtml), but can be used with many radios be means of adapters.  
The [AB-1241](https://www.prc68.com/I/AS2259.shtml#1241) patio umbrella base, hubcap base was designed for use with the PRC-104, but only using a very short coax cable (non 50 Ohm).  

  

There is a BNC(f) antenna connector that can be used two ways:  
  
With an antenna that has a 50 Ohm RF impedance and the internal antenna tuner is disabled, but the VSWR sensor is still checking for a good match.  
With an antenna that's NOT 50 Ohms and the internal antenna tuner is active.  

###  Audio Connector  

The two Audio connectors take the standard [U-229 accessories](https://www.prc68.com/I/U229AA.shtml), [U-229 Pin out](https://www.prc68.com/I/U229PO.shtml).  When a modified [LS-454](https://www.prc68.com/I/LS454.shtml)  speaker is connected there's plenty of volume from the stock PRC-104 for indoor use, and maybe for outdoors.  
The AUDIO connectors are wired:  

Pin  

Function  

A  

Ground  

B  

Speaker  

C  

PTT  

D  

Mike  

E  

CW*  

  
* Instead of connecting to the PTT line, the CW key must be connected to pin E. There are a couple of reasons for this.   
  
One is to support the [GRA-71](https://www.prc68.com/I/GRA71.shtml) 300 WPM Morse transmission.  The [PRC-64](https://www.prc68.com/I/PRC-64.html) & PRC-74 use the same AUDIO connector pin out, and if it has the 6 pin connector, the center pin is +12 Volts to power the GRA-71.  When pin E is used for CW an audio tone is injected resulting in a single carrier signal being sent.  
  
The other is that when sending CW from an HF radio in SSB mode if the PTT is used there will be no output because sideband signals are only present when there is some voice modulation.

"The AN/PRC-104 Manpack Radio is being developed by Hughes Aircraft Company, Ground Systems Group, Fullerton, CA for the U.S. Marine Coops under Contract N00039-74-C-0357."  I think they were also working the the TPQ-36 and/or TPQ-37 mortor and artillery gun location systems.   
> >   
> > There are no photographs in the brochure, only drawings.  The actual PRC-104 looks different in a number of details that are both cosmetic and functional.  For example the small battery box is shown with tapered lower ends, both on the cover and inside.  The top of the small battery box is shown as a lid that can be opened to allow battery pack installation, but my small battery box has a removable end, not top.  There is also an illustration of a chopper where the RT-1209 is located in the cockpit and the amplifier, whether 20, 100 or 400 Watts is mounted near where the HF antenna enters the chopper, about the middle.  This implies that an extension cable could be used between the RT-1209 and an amplifier.  Another illustration shows AM-6879 that is an audio amplifier, power supply and RTTY converter to be used for vehicle mounting, but not with the 400 Watt power amplifier that makes a GRC-193().  The description of the amplifier antenna coupler says it's a 30 Watt amplifier and the specifications table says 20 Watts output +/- 2 dB (20 Watts + 2 dB = 37 Watts)  
> >

> #### Interface Connector
> 
> There is a 48 pin connector that interfaces the AM-6874 and the RT-1209.  This connector supplies DC power into the RT-1209 and from the RT-1209 the low level RF is supplied to the Amplifier Coupler along with digital frequency information to tell the amplifier coupler the radios operating frequency.  The pins are designated using numbers at the start and end of 9 rows.  In the center there is a hex depression with the corners lettered N, Z, Y, X, W, V.  
>   
> The RT-1029 has two 4-40 tapped inserts on about 1 9/16" centers and the AM-6874 has a couple of 4-40 screws on about 1 9/16" centers.  These could be used to hold a bracket with a mating connector to allow the two units to be separated, like in a helicopter as shown in the Hughes Sales Brochure.

> > So here's the latest. Two things need to be done in the 1209A RT to enable operation below 2 MHz:  
> >   
> > 1) The RT has harmonic filters which are selected by logic in a hybrid in the control panel. When the dial frequency is below 2 MHz none of these filters are selected and there is no path for the RF on either receive or transmit. The 2-3 MHz filter must be enabled to operate below 2 MHz; it is fine for 160 M use as it only drops off 1 dB at 1.8 MHz. It does, however, start to fall off a cliff below that.  
> >   
> > 2) The amp/tuner unit takes MHZ info from the RT and uses this to select ranges for inductance and capacitance. It makes this determination based on logic in a hybrid so cannot be changed. When it is told a 1 MHz range frequency is selected it doesn't operate properly (I did not investigate further as to precisely what it does). There is also logic in the tuner to give a continuous "out of range" error beeping when the frequency selected is under 2 MHz. I decided that rather than modify two devices I would simply modify the MHz information the RT sends to the amp/tuner so as to "fake it out." When a frequency in the 1 MHz range is dialed up I simply tell the amp/tuner it is in the 2 MHz range and the tuner operates in its highest capacitance and inductance range.  
> >   
> > What I did was to lift two diodes on the flex board behind the front panel and attach a series of wires. I also picked up ground, +12 volts and the harmonic filter relay coil. Here's a photo of the wires: [http://petergottlieb.com/images/prc104/DSC03758.JPG](http://petergottlieb.com/images/prc104/DSC03758.JPG)  
> >   
> > I ran the wires into the compartment where the modulator PCB is as there is room under it for a small additional PCB with the needed extra components. For the moment, I put what I needed onto a protoboard so the wires are just hanging out: [http://petergottlieb.com/images/prc104/DSC03761.JPG](http://petergottlieb.com/images/prc104/DSC03761.JPG)  
> >   
> > You may wonder what I did in the circuit itself. I needed logic to change a 1 MHz BCD word to a 2 MHz BCD word and also drive an open collector transistor to pull in the filter relay when this is done. I went with Eugene Hertz's suggestion to use an EPROM. There are several things to consider:  
> > 1) Due to the diodes, which convert 12 volt logic to 5 volt logic, I needed two 100k pullup resistors on the lines I intercepted (1 and 2 MHz)  
> > 2) I used a CMOS EPROM, the smallest I had was a Fujitsu 27C64. Vast overkill, I'm only using 30 locations out of 8,192.  
> > 3) No 5 volts is available so I took +12.5 and used a 7805 to make my own. 6.5 is also available but that's a little tight for the old 7805. All I really need is a 78L05 because I'm hardly taking any current but I didn't have one laying around.  
> > 4) The open collector drive is very basic: an output of the EPROM drives a 2N2222 through a 1k resistor. It would probably be better to use a higher resistor but that's what was closest at hand. I bet driving that transistor is my biggest current draw.  
> >   
> > How does it work? Here is a photo of my counter when in USB CW mode: [http://petergottlieb.com/images/prc104/DSC03762.JPG](http://petergottlieb.com/images/prc104/DSC03762.JPG)  
> >   
> > My frequency is pretty darn close (the counter is referenced to a Rb), something like 0.1 Hz low.  
> >   
> > The last step will be to get a 78L05 and build this onto a small board and mount it under the modulator board.  
> >   
> > If anyone wants the binary file for the EPROM and the wiring diagram, I'll be preparing those. It is also quite possible to build the logic with a few CMOS chips and it would work the same. Once I get everything finished I'll make a document and put it on my site for anyone to download and otherwise spread around.  
> >   
> > There is one thing which is a slight hack, and that is that I don't stop operation below 1.8 MHz. However, the AM station I listen to for weather is there and with 50 kW the degraded sensitivity isn't a problem. If you try to transmit (why?) you will find the output power goes down dramatically below 1.8 MHz as transmit goes through the same filter as receive. I decided to leave that be as I don't have any intention to transmit there and with the power getting so low I'm sure it won't hurt the unit.  
> >   
> > One note about the built in tuner: its configuration seems to be mostly designed to tune antennas which are capacitive, or shorter than what should be, such as the whip. My setup is inductive at those frequencies so it doesn't do well, but that has nothing to do with this mod.

> ### AM-6874  20 (+/- 2 dB) Watt Amplifier/Antenna Coupler
> 
> The Antenna select switch has 3 positions  
> 
> -   9 to 16 foot Whip antenna, or a 1/4 wave long wire, where the coupler tunes the antenna.
> -   External antenna on BNC connector where the coupler tunes the antenna, like the [AS-2259](https://www.prc68.com/I/AS2259.shtml) with a non tuned BNC base and a short coax feed line.  Could use a cable to seperate the RT-1209 from the AM-6874 so the AM-6874 would end up near the antenna feed point improving the antenna match and eliminating any coax loss.  This might be a way around my current problem using the AS-2259 with the radio indoors (50 feet of coax away . .  this does NOT work.)  
>     
> -   External antenna on BNC connector where the external antenna is near 50 Ohms impedance.  No practical length limit on coax feed.  
>     
> 
> If the wrong External BNC antenna switch position is used you will get a 12 second tune tone followed by an error beeping tone.  
> Then just turn the radio off, back on, set the ANT switch to the other BNC position, and key PTT.  
>   
> 
> Note: the sales brochure mentions that both the whip and a coax connected antenna can both be connected at the same time to allow switching back and forth to choose the best one.

 This unit contains an audio amplifier, a RTTY converter supporting 20 or 60 ma current loop and a squelch circuit, but it appears to NOT have a VIC-1 interface connector like the AM-7152.  Note that the RT-1209 typically sits to the right of the AM-6879 and a "W-1 Power, Control & RF Cable" is used to connect the two boxes instead of a direct cabless connection like is used when the RT-1209 is mounted on the left of the AM-6874.  Note the RF is passed as is between the AM-6879 and RT-1209().  That means the AM-6879 can be used for testing the RT since you have access the the raw RF output and input on J7 (Type-N jack).  A special cable would need to be made for J5 to feed DC power and control signals and to monitor the control signals.

## GRC-193A NSN 5820-01-133-4195

This is a selectable 100 Watt or 400 Watt vehicle system.  Is does NOT seem to support VIC-1 and therefore can not be used as part of a  retransmission system, like the GRC-213.

> ### Description
> 
> > There are two functional additions to the PRC-104 to make a GRC-213.   
> >   
> > First the AM-7152 adds audio amplification, noise squelch and a [VIC-1](https://www.prc68.com/I/VIC.shtml#VRC12) connection.  Note that the PRC-104 does not have any squelch at all, so this is a big improvement.  The AM-7152 also does some DC power conditioning.  Not sure what it all is, but there are some very large capacitors in the box.  The PRC-104 is designed to run from a [BA-5590](https://www.prc68.com/I/BA5590.shtml) which starts out at 30 Volts and goes down.  A military vehicle "24 Volt" system might be anywhere between 20 and 30 Volts, so there may or may not be active voltage regulation.  
> >   
> > [FM 24-19 Chapter 1](http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/library/policy/army/fm/24-19/Ch1.htm) shows a retransmission system based on the GRC-213 and [VRC-12](https://www.prc68.com/I/VIC.shtml) series radio, so it appears the main reason the GRC-213 was built is for retransmission applications.  In Fig 1-20 they are showing the [AM-1780 and the C-2299 and one C-2298](https://www.prc68.com/I/VIC.shtml) connected to J504, i.e. a commander's connection.  
> >   
> > This system was designed to be VRC-12 Series compatible.  The mount bolts to the same plate that supports the MT-1029, the VIC-1 and DC power in and out connections are the same as on the MT-1029.  The [LS-454](https://www.prc68.com/I/LS454.shtml) is a VRC-12 Series speaker.  Any vehicle setup with an RT-246, RT-524 or [PRC-25](https://www.prc68.com/I/PRC25.shtml) or [PRC-77](https://www.prc68.com/I/PRC77.shtml) on the [AM-2060](https://www.prc68.com/I/AM2060.shtml) could easily be converted to use the GRC-213 or become a cross band [retransmission](https://www.prc68.com/I/Audio.shtml#Ret) system linking VHF low band with HF.  
> >   
> > As far as I can tell all the other systems based on the RT-1209 are NOT VRC-12 compatible, i.e. they do not have the VIC-1 interface.  This means that they can not easily be used for retransmission.  Also note that for retransmission you need squelch to generate the retransmission PTT output, so other audio amplifiers that do not have squelch can not be used for retransmission.  
> >   
> > Second the SA-2365 Antenna switch box which is part of the MT-2154 mount assembly that comes with the install kit goes between the existing PRC-104 antenna BNC connector and the actual antenna in use.  The Antenna Loading Switch has positions for 2 - 10 MHz, 10 - 30 MHz to an external 15 or 16 foot whip or a Dipole.  It's designed to supply some simple fixed tuning (maybe an RF cap.) for a 16 Foot long [AT1011](https://www.prc68.com/I/AT1011.shtml) type vehicle antenna.  There are two connectors on the rear of the SA-2365, J203 is a BNC(f) and J202 is a Type-N(f).  J202 is used to connect to the 15' whip using as short a coax cable as is practicable.

![Audio Y Cable](https://www.prc68.com/I/Images/GRC213_755002C0500.JPG)Cable 755002C0500 - This is a "Y" cable that provides an AUDIO jack after the other two connections have been made to the AM-7152 and RT-1209, thus not using up an AUDIO connector on the radio.  It also has a short tether that can be connected to the AM-7152 so that it will not get lost.  
  
  
  
  
  
  

### Operation

June 2004 - I'm using the GRC-213 indoors powered by a lab DC supply.  The outside antenna is a T2FD which makes a poor transmit antenna because of the termination.  The T2FD antenna is configured as a sloper so should work NVIS mode.  I'm working stations out to about 400 miles with good copy when the FoF2 layer is cooperating (summer evening) on 5,371.5 MHz (60 meters).  
  
It would be nice to have more Tx power, but that will not improve the Rx sensitivity.  Maybe a [GRA-50](https://www.prc68.com/I/GRA50.shtml) dipole is a better choice mounted about 0.1 to 0.1 wavelength above ground for good NVIS propagation.  
  
The AB1241 "small Patio Umbrella" base for the [AS-2259](https://www.prc68.com/I/AS2259.shtml) does not like to be driven with 50 feet of coax, it needs a short ( 2 ft.) coax connection to the amplifier-coupler.  
  
The Squelch provided by the AM-7152 allows you to leave the radio on and when there's a "CQ" you can respond.  In all cases where I could hear the other station I could work them on the T2FD antenna.  

### AM-7152 NSN 5820-01-127-5855  

The rear panel connectors are the standard mil vehicle type and are functionally the same as what's on the [MT-1029](https://www.prc68.com/I/MT1029.shtml).  
DC In -J101 corresponds to J21 on the MT-1029  
[VIC](https://www.prc68.com/I/VIC.shtml) or crypto interface - J102 corresponds to J22 on the MT-1029  
DC out - J103 corresponds to J23 on the MT-1029  
J104 is the conditioned DC going to the PRC-104 Battery connection.  
  
Inside the AM-7152 there is a fuse, but I don't see any adjustable link, like the link in the MT-1029.  It'll take some Ohm meter work to find out which way the DC is routed.  

#### General Use

#### Squelch

The AM-7152 connects to the radio using a standard U-229 cable to the AUDIO connector on the radio, thus allowing it to connect to any military radio that has a U-229 AUDIO connector (or probably others with an adapter cable).  This would be handy for radios that do not have built-in squelch.  

#### VIC-1

Also the AM-7152 provides an easy way to interface a radio with VIC-1 equipment and standard military vehicle power in and out 4 contact connectors.   

#### DC Power

The AM-7152 has a regulated power supply putting out about 25 Volts and something over 3 Amps that could drive another radio with an adapter cable.  

#### DC Current

The combined PRC-104 & AM-7152 draws about 0.31 Amps from a 30.0 VDC source and about 0.32 Amps from 27.0 Volts.  
Tx current is around 1 Amp for average speech and just over 3 Amps for CW key down or speech peaks.

* BK Precision 1786 DC power supply rated for 30 Volts @ 3.0 Amps  
  
Note the DC power consumed is about constant with varying input voltage which is consistent with a switching mode power supply in the PRC-104.  
  
The Squelch function is more of an audio attenuator, rather than a turn off the audio type squelch.  Maybe there's an adjustment in the AM-7152 that would allow more reduction in audio volume?  
  
The radio is picking up signals generated by my computer.  It's not clear if this is because the radio is near the computer (although the antenna is connected by coax, there may be leakage into the DC power wiring.  
  
You would think that a M-80 microphone could be used since the AM-7152 is driving a speaker, but this is not the case.  An H-250 handset is still needed so that the operator can hear the side tone that is an indication that the antenna tuner is working and that a signal is getting out.   The beep-beep-beep antenna warning tone is quite loud in the speaker, but the short beep to let you know the antenna is being tuned does not show up in the speaker.

### C-2299 Radio Relay Control Box

[![Radio Retransmission system PRC-104,
GRC-213, C-2299 & VRC-64](https://www.prc68.com/I/Images/GRC213_VRC64cs.jpg)](https://www.prc68.com/I/Images/GRC213_VRC64cb.jpg)

   A simpler way to get a RETRANS system is to just use the C-2299 directly between the two radios (without any AM-1780).  
When the C-2299 has RETRANS set to OFF the other switch selects RT 1 or RT 2 for connection to the handset on the C-2299 providing remote control of two RTs or RETRANS capability.  This would allow the GRC-213 to be interconnected with a [VRC-64](file:///C:/Webdocs_Hosted/I/PRC77.shtml#Cfg).  
  
With the GRC-213 connected to RETRANS with the PRC-77/VRC-64 I could carry a [PRC-68 family](file:///C:/Webdocs/PRC68FAM.shtml) VHF low band radio around my property and work stations on HF via the GRC-213.  Note that RETRANS works both ways so that I could transmit to and receive from the HF station on the VHF low band radio.  
  
14 July 2004 - It's working.  When the squelch opens on either the HF or VHF radio the other radio has it's carrier keyed.  The audio from the BC-611 is weak in SSB receiving mode, but it's there and can be understood.   
  
Note the radio connected to C-2299-J701 is supplying power the the mike amp in the C-2299.  So if you want to use a handset connected to C-2299-J703 or J704 the radio connected to J701 needs to be powered.  There is no DC  path from J702 to the mike amp.  
  
For this test I have disconnected the J-3514 from the MT-1029 and am connecting the C-2299 directly to the MT-1099.  Also the CX-13065A cable has been disconnected from the [AM-2060](file:///C:/Webdocs_Hosted/I/AM2060.shtml) and [PRC-77](file:///C:/Webdocs_Hosted/I/PRC77.shtml) and a CX-4655 interconnects the AM-2060 and PRC-77.  Making this an ordinary VRC-64 ([non VINSON](file:///C:/Webdocs_Hosted/I/MT1029.shtml#V)) VHF radio set.  
  
The GRC-213 is connected to the T2FD antenna and the PRC-77 is connected to the [OE-254](file:///C:/Webdocs_Hosted/I/OE254/OE254.shtml).  The NRD-545 is using a VHF Radio Shack scanner monitor antenna and the BC-611 is using it's built in whip.  
  
I'm setting the PRC-77 to SQUELCH mode, not RETRANS, since RETRANS is for use with the MK-456.  This system uses the squelch breaking to trigger RETRANS through the VIC-1 type connection.  

  
Note it takes 4 radios to make up a minimal cross band retransmission system.  I'm using a [BC-611](https://www.prc68.com/I/BC611.shtml) as the external HF radio, it transmits AM which includes both USB and LSB.  When I key the BC-611 I can hear my voice in the GRC-213 speaker.  I'm using the [NRD-545](https://www.prc68.com/I/NRD545/NRD545.shtml) as the VHF monitor.  

### Mk-456 Not Used

The [Mk-456 RETRANS Cable](https://www.prc68.com/I/Mk456.shtml) is NOT compatible with the RT-1209 audio connectors.  On the RT-1209 pin "E" is used for the slow or high speed CW key input and on the PRC-25/PRC-77 pin "E" is used for the RETRANS PTT output.  Also the RT-1209 has no squelch and so no RETRANS key signal.

## GRC-206 Program Pacer Speak

This vehicle mounted system allows two operators, one Army and one Air Force to coordinate air strikes.  Mort GRC-206 info on the [MT-6250](https://www.prc68.com/I/MT6250.shtml) web page with links to the rest of the components.  
  
Designed to be installed in the M151, M113 and the [HMMWV](https://www.prc68.com/I/HMMWV.shtml).  The AN/MRC-144 is a mobile HF/VHF/UHF HAVE QUICK II capable communications facility (AN/GRC-206(V)3) mounted in an M-998 Highly Mobile Multi-Wheeled Vehicle (HMMWV). It provides single sideband (SSB) HF, VHF/FM, VHF/AM, and UHF communications. This system can be remoted up to two kilometers. The HF radio has secure phone patch capability and all radios have secure voice capability. Note the HMMWV has a trailer, probably with a MEP-802A diesel generator, fuel and storage for equipment.  The army HMMWV mounted system is called the AN/TSQ-198 Tactical Terminal Control System (TTCS).

------------------------  Starting with the top row of the [MT-6250](https://www.prc68.com/I/MT6250.shtml) rack:  

#### First VRC-83 Aircraft Radio  

The VRC-83 combines the manpack RT-1319/PRC-113 dual band (116-150, 225-400 + 243 MHz guard) aircraft radio with the [AM-7176 RF Amp](https://www.prc68.com/I/AM-7176A.html) and VRC-83 vehicle mount.  The AM-7176 also contains the digital interface between the RT-1319 and the C-11169.  This RT-1319 is the UHF-AM frequency hopping radio and so needs the Time Of Day (TOD).  Frequency hopping is not a way to secure crypto cover for the message traffic, it is an anti jam measure.  For that the KY-57 located just below the radio is used.  
  
Each of the two VTC-83 radios is dedicated to one band.  For example this one is the UHF-AM only.  There's a couple of reasons for doing that.  First, there are a number of UHF aircraft antennas that can be used but very few combined VHF & UHV aircraft band antennas.  Second Have Quick frequency hopping is used in the UHF band but it's not clear if it's used in the VHF aircraft band.  The O-1814 is only cabled to one of the VRC-83 radios and this is the one it would go to.  
  
The way the C11166 Control is laid out confirms that one of the VRC-83 radios is dedicated to UHF-AM  and the other one to VHF-AM.  By using the same radio for two different functions there are benefits rather than use two different radios.  

#### [O-1814](https://www.prc68.com/I/O1814.shtml) Rubidium Frequency Standard

The [O-1814](https://www.prc68.com/I/O1814.shtml) Rubidium Frequency Standard maintains the TOD with high accuracy.  I think the reason for using a Rb frequency standard in this system while you don't see them in Army SINCGARS installations is the need for UTC accurate TOD.  In the army application the net controller can set the TOD and download that time into all the netted radios.  Even if the net control time is wrong all the radios will interoperate.   But when an aircraft is inbound from someplace far away (the TOD on the aircraft was set at it's home base) the TOD of the aircraft and the Pacer Speak system need to be the same for the radios to interoperate.  It is only used on the UHF-AM radio.  
  
Second generation and newer UHF-AM radios incorporate Have Quick ([Wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HAVE_QUICK)) which includes the ability to transfer a precision Time Of Day over the air.  This eliminates the need for an atomic clock in the GRC-206 system.  

#### URC-113 HF Radio

The RT-1209 from a PRC-104 has the RT-1444 remote control add on, or the RT-1209A or B with built in remote interface are used with the [AM-7148](https://www.prc68.com/I/AM7148.shtml) Amplifier/Coupler Solid State 150 Watt amplifier works with the RT-1209 or the RT-1444 22.5 to 30 VDC input , 17.5 Amps at 27.5 VDC.  
  
Starting with the (V)5 system the PRC-104 has been replaced with the PRC-150.  
  
--------------------  The middle row:  

#### [KY-57](https://www.prc68.com/I/KY57.shtml)

Two KY-57s to support the two aircraft radios.  

#### [KY-65](https://www.prc68.com/I/KY65.shtml)

A KY-65 to support the HF radio.  

#### Storage Drawer above KY-65?

#### [C-11169](https://www.prc68.com/I/C11169GRC206.shtml) Signal Distribution Unit (SDU)  

All the radios are cabled to this box.  It can be connected to the control box using either fiber optic or twisted pair metallic cable.  There will be a cable going to each of the four radios as well as a power cable.  Note most of these boxes have all the receptacles on the front panel.  The system photo was taken with all the cables removed.  If they were installed you probably could not see much else.  

#### [SB-4151](https://www.prc68.com/I/SB4151GRC206.shtml) DC Power Distribution Unit (PDU)  

A control panel allowing you to turn off radios not being used.  This system runs from "24 Volt" vehicle power, Auxiliary Power or a Motor/Generator.

> 
> #### Second VRC-83 Aircraft Radio
> 
> The same as the first VRC-83 and it's KY-57 is just above the radio.  This one is dedicated to VHF-AM operation so only needs an antenna that covers that band.
> 
> #### KY-57 for VHF Low Band Radio
> 
> The RT-524 and first generation [SINCGARS](https://www.prc68.com/I/sincgars.shtml) radio, the [RT-1439](https://www.prc68.com/I/RT1439.shtml) need an external KY-57 for voice security.  The newer SINCGARS RT-1523 has internal voice crypto and so does not need that KY-57.  
> 
> #### [H-250](https://www.prc68.com/I/H250.shtml) Storage Box above KY-57
> 
> "That was a handmic box. We stored the H-250's in there so they wouldn't bang around. Other times it was to hold the instruction manual to the pallet. Not quite water tight but it kept a majority of the crud out."  
> -Charlie-  
> 
> #### Army VHF Low Band Radio
> 
> First generation systems used the RT-524 radio on the MT-1029.  This is a [VRC-12](https://www.prc68.com/I/VIC.shtml#VRC12) series radio and has no remote control capability.  The second generation systems use the [RT-1439](https://www.prc68.com/I/RT1439.shtml) first generation [SINCGARS](https://www.prc68.com/I/sincgars.shtml) radios.  I think in the dual radio mount allowing one of them to use an external RF power amplifier.  These radios have limited remote control based on the audio tone system which can select a channel number but not setup a channel frequency or other channel setup parameters.  The various newer RT-1523 versions have the same remote control capability but also include built-in voice security and so the third KY-57 is not needed.  
>   
> Different versions of the GRC-206 system have used the different Army VHF-FM radios starting with either the RT-524 or the 10 channel RT-246 (it's not clear to me which) then the RT-1439 that has 6 channels as does the RT-1523.  The operator can select which of the preprogrammed channels to use.  The implication is that there's some commonality in the channel selection method for the VRC-12 series radios and the SINCGARS radios.  
>   
> But the C-2742 used with the RT-246 uses a very basic one wire per channel type control whereas the SINCGARS radios use serial data stream via an audio modem.  So there must have been a serial to parallel converter in the GRC-206 system when (if?) it was used with the RT-246.  If that's the case then the serial protocol in the SINCGARS radios may have been made to the the same one?

## RT-1444 Remote appliqué

> The RT-1444 is a remote controllable version of the manually operated RT-1209.  Note that the RT-1209A has a built in remote control capability by means of the CONT connector located above the the single AUDIO connector.  The unit pictured here is inserted between the front panel and the main body of the RT-1209  to make the resulting radio into an RT-1444/PRC-104.  J1 is the 18 male pin ITT Cannon connector that has an internal 16 wire ribbon cable connecting to it.  Most of the box is hollow and from the cavity there is a ribbon cable with a 18 + 17 + 16 three row "D" shaped connector with 51 male pins.  On the other face there is a similar 51 pin connector with sockets.  Thus the RT-1444 can be inserted between the front panel and the RT chassis.  There are a couple of multilayer printed circuit boards and a number of large ICs, probably a microprocessor, RAMs and PROMs.  
>   
> Jan 2009 - The Remote was made to allow the RT-1209 to be used with the GRC-206 (URC-113 uses the [AM-7148](file:///C:/Webdocs_Hosted/I/AM7148.shtml) RF Amp) or the [GRC-193](https://www.prc68.com/I/GRC193.shtml) (uses the AM-6545 RF Amp).  In either case the RF amp needs the MHz frequency information from the RT-1209.  Also the GRC-206 allows remote setting and read back of the radio frequency.  Later GRC-206 systems used the PRC-138 to get ALE capability and the [RT-1444A](https://www.prc68.com/I/PRC104.shtml#RT-1444A) adapter box similar to the RT-1444 that had ALE capability was aimed at this application, but I don't think it was chosen.  
>   
> The [RT-1444A](file:///C:/Webdocs_Hosted/I/PRC104.shtml#RT-1444A) has had the internal PCB removed and replaced with a new set of boards and has ALE capability.  The 1040 upgrade kit was sold by [NSG Datacom](http://www.nsgdata.com/) (took over the Frederick Electronics product line) to the Swedish Army for use in PRC-104 systems.  I don't think the AM-7148 RF Amplifier/Coupler can tune the antenna fast enough for ALE, although if used with a matched antenna, like the B&W terminated folded dipoles might work if the band switching time is short enough.

> Pin R - Remote Select - probably chooses between an active front panel and remote control.  Since this is the inverted signal, an open means not-remote and a grounded pin means remote.  That way when no cable is connected the radio works from the front panel.  I was told that the remote cable just has a jumper between "R" and ground.  A better way would be to allow a remote computer decide to allow the radio to be in remote or local mode.  
>   
> Pin L (clock) & Pin U (/clock) probably are for serial data streams "Control" and "Status", where "Control" most likely means commands to the RT-1444 and "Status" means data coming from the RT-1444, like frequency, etc. and maybe error codes.

> TM 11-5820-40-1 Table 1-4 Cable W2 RT Control has pinout information that's related, but it uses a parallel (one wire for each front panel button) protocol, meaning that somewhere else there's a serial/parallel converter.  

## RT-1444A ALE & Remote appliqué

> This unit is physically the same as the RT-1444 and is installed between the front panel and the main radio chassis in the same way.   
> It provides ALE capability.  It uses the KGV-10 hopping controller that's used in the SINCGARS radios.  The first SINCGARS radios ([Wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SINCGARS#Timeline)) were built in the 1983 time line with the RT-1439 produced in 1988.  So it makes sense that both these radios use the same frequency hopping control IC.
