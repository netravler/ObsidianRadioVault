^obituary
_**Ronald Lee Dugan,** 75, Elkland, Missouri was born February 22, 1946 to Dean R. and Mary Frances (Day) Dugan in Marshfield, Missouri.  Ron departed this life at his home in Elkland, Missouri on January 3, 2022._

_He was preceded in death by his parents, Dean and Mary Frances Dugan; and his brother, David Dugan._

_Ron is survived by his brothers, Ben Dugan (Velma) and Rick Dugan; his sister, Denise Dugan; stepdaughter, Cinammon Judd (Steven); step granddaughters, Audrey Whitworth, Halley Judd and Hannah Cook; nieces and nephews, Deborah D. Heintz (Paul), Kimberly G. Lewis, Kayla Dugan, Lance B. Dugan (Amanda), Isabella, Hunter, Caidan, Angela Carter (Buck), Jackson. Wyatt, Stacey Wilcox (Gary), Caleb, Josh, Evie, Laurie Dugan, Katie Butler (Christopher), Nora, Ryan Dugan, Christopher Adrian (Amanda), Noah, Wallace, and Jordan Adrian; as well as a host of family and friends._

_Ron was a lifetime farmer and resident of Elkland, Missouri.  He graduated Marshfield High School and attended college at Missouri University, Columbia, Missouri and graduated from Missouri State University in Springfield, Missouri.  Ron returned to the family farm where he remained until his passing.  Ron will always be known to Elkland folks as “The Mayor” of Elkland.  It should be noted, “we have yet to find the first person who actually voted for him”.  Always happy (almost) and blessed with the Gift of Blarney (An Irish Tradition) when Ron Dugan entered the room, laughter was soon to follow._

_While he will be missed greatly by the family, we believe the town of Elkland just lost its finest ambassador.  Happy Trails Big Brother.  Say “Hello” to Mom, Dad and Dave for all of us._

_Celebration of Life services for Ronald Lee Dugan will be held 12:00 p.m. Saturday, January 8, 2022 at Day Funeral Home, Marshfield, Missouri.  Visitation will be held 10:30 a.m. to 12:00 p.m. Saturday, January 8, 2022 in the funeral home chapel.  Memorial donations may be made to Marshfield Public School Foundation and left in care of the funeral home.  Due to Covid 19 the family requests that masks and social distancing be implemented during the service and visitation._
