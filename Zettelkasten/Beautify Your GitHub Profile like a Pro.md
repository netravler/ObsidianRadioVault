# Beautify Your GitHub Profile like a Pro

![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1*cJ7GLIEe1CDkJ6JWS7ZkQA.jpeg)

If you have ever used **GitHub**, you must have come across some impressive-looking profiles and thought “Damn! I want my profile to look like that.” Well, this article will help you with precisely that.

# 1. Add a `ReadMe`

This is simply the easiest way to boost the visual appeal of your profile many folds. To create a `ReadMe` for your **GitHub** profile, create a new repository with your username.

![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/0*9MTdHsGkSrZTg-C-.png)

Initialize the repository with a `ReadMe.md` file and anything you write in the file will be shown in your **GitHub** Profile.

![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1*kdzwGjiaJhldZr_hWU9aqw.png)

The `ReadMe` is the perfect place to describe yourself, list out your achievements and skills. You can also add badges like these to make your profile look even more attractive.

![](https://miro.medium.com/max/242/0*c7nN4joZSANcV6ET)

To create the badge the syntax is:

![<Badge Name>](https://img.shields.io/badge/<Badge Text>-<Background Color>?style=for-the-badge&logo=<Icon Name>&logoColor=<Logo Color>)

So the **GitHub** badge would look like:

![github](https://img.shields.io/badge/GitHub-000000?style=for-the-badge&logo=GitHub&logoColor=white)]

You can browse through the list of available icons on [Simple Icons](https://simpleicons.org/)

# 2. Manage your Repositories

**GitHub** allows you to pin _Repositories_ and _Gists_ in your profile. This is a remarkable feature that enables you to display the things you want to showcase.

It’s also a good idea to add _details_, _tags_ and _emojis_ to make the repository more engaging.

![](https://miro.medium.com/max/656/0*KQqr50E5Z982oCkv.PNG)

As you can see, the one with details is way more engaging than the one without any.

# 3. Contribute, Contribute and Contribute some more!

This is simply the most important step to make your **GitHub** look awesome! I get it, getting started is scary, so if you need help, check out [this article](https://tapajyoti-bose.medium.com/zero-to-hero-get-started-with-open-source-projects-985b95d37710) on how to get started with **Open Source Development**. You don’t have to start with huge features or projects; begin with _documentation fixes_, then move on to _tiny bug fixes_ and _features_.

**Open Source Development** can boost your profile regardless if you are going for a _job interview_ or _freelancing_. After a few good contributions, you will start getting job offers from various companies.

![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/0*Up4EveUNN_278pwx.PNG)

One essential thing to keep in mind is: **DO NOT TRY TO CHEAT THE PROCESS**. Every one of your contributions is listed on **GitHub**. There are a lot of people who create fake issues to get a green dot for contribution. This only creates _negative impression_ on the person viewing your profile.

If you keep making tiny incremental improvements, you will make it; if you try to use a shortcut, you will likely crash and burn. As the saying goes, “Slow and steady wins the race.”

Best of luck on your **GitHub** Journey!

## Supercharge Your Website Using PWA: Installable Website

What is a PWA? Progressive Web Apps (PWA) are web applications that have been designed so they are capable (utilize native features), reliable (work even in offline mode), and installable. These three pillars transform them into an experience that feels like a platform-specific application. Why use PWA? At their heart, Progressive Web Apps are just web applications…
