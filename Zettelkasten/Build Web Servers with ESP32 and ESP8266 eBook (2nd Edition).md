## About the eBook

This eBook covers HTML, CSS, JavaScript and client-server communication protocols so that you’re able to build your own web server projects with the ESP32 and ESP8266 boards from scratch.

The boards will be programmed using the Arduino “programming language” and we’ll use Visual Studio Code + PlatformIO IDE to program the boards. The eBook also provides instructions on how to proceed if you want to use Arduino IDE instead.

The resources in this eBook are **compatible with both ESP32 and ESP8266 NodeMCU boards**.

If you search the web, you’ll find hundreds of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript tutorials. However, with this eBook we have a unique approach. The goal of this training is to teach you the basics of these technologies applied to web servers that you can build with the ESP32 or ESP8266 boards.

-   **HTML** to define the content of web pages
-   **CSS** to style the web pages
-   **JavaScript** to program the behavior of web pages
-   **Client-server communication protocols** to interact between the browser and the ESP

This eBook walks you through building web pages with practical examples that you can follow along and test in real time.

If you want to control the ESP boards GPIOs or display sensor readings using a web server, this is the perfect chance for you to learn how to do it from scratch.

### Module #3: ESP32 and ESP8266 Web Servers

![](https://i0.wp.com/randomnerdtutorials.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Module-3-thumbnail-500.jpg?resize=500%2C281&quality=100&strip=all&ssl=1)

Learn how to build web server projects with the ESP32 and ESP8266 boards to control outputs and monitor sensors remotely. You will create web pages to control outputs (buttons, toggle switches, and slider) and display sensor readings (text, tables and charts).

Add user input fields to save parameters, create a Wi-Fi Manager, add OTA (over-the-air) capabilities to your projects and serve multiple web pages with navigation bar.

You’ll also learn different client-server communication protocols: HTTP requests, WebSocket and Server-Sent Events (SSE).

### What do you need to follow the eBook?

To follow the projects in the eBook you can either use an ESP32 or ESP8266 board. We usually use the _ESP32 DEVKIT DOIT_ board, but you can use any other ESP32 board.

As for the ESP8266, we use the _ESP8266-12E NodeMCU Kit_, but once again you are free to use any other ESP8266 board.

![ESP32 vs ESP8266 Development Boards](https://i0.wp.com/randomnerdtutorials.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/esp32-vs-esp8266-devlopment-boards.jpg?resize=542%2C304&quality=100&strip=all&ssl=1)

The projects throughout this eBook don’t require an extensive list of parts. You just need some LEDs and resistors, jumper wires, a breadboard and a BME280 sensor. Then, you should be able to modify the projects to control other outputs and use any other sensors or inputs.

---

### Programming Environment

The ESP32 and ESP8266 boards are programmed using the Arduino “programming language”. To program the boards we’ll use Visual Studio Code with the PlatformIO IDE extension. Visual Studio Code is free and runs on Windows, Linux and Mac OS X operating systems.

![](https://i0.wp.com/randomnerdtutorials.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Installing-Visual-Studio-Code-Thumbnail-500px.jpg?resize=500%2C281&quality=100&strip=all&ssl=1)

We’ll also use Visual Studio Code to write the HTML, CSS and JavaScript files,.

**Why VS Code + PlatformIO IDE?**

The Arduino IDE works great for small applications. However, for advanced projects with more than 200 lines of code, multiple files, and other advanced features like auto completion and error checking, VS Code with the PlatformIO IDE extension is the best alternative.

Additionally, it is easier to manage libraries and you won’t have trouble with missing dependencies which happens often when using Arduino IDE.

However, nothing stops you from following the projects using Arduino IDE. We include instructions on how to proceed if you want to use Arduino IDE instead. If you choose this option, you need to have another program, a Text Editor, to write the HTML, CSS and JavaScript files.

### Who is this eBook for?

This eBook is for those who want to learn how to build their own web servers with the ESP32 and ESP8266 from scratch. This includes building the web page using HTML, CSS and JavaScript as well as programming the server (ESP board) using the Arduino “programming language”.
