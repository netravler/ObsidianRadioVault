**Hiren’s BootCD PE** supports **UEFI** booting from DVD and USB flash drives. To format, re-partition your USB drive and to copy the ISO content into your USB drive properly, we have developed Hiren’s BootCD PE – ISO2USB portable tool. You need **Administrator** privileges to run it. It is free both for commercial and non-commercial use. Requires Windows 7 and later.

If you desire to manually partition / format your USB Flash drive, please follow the steps of **“[How can I manually partition / format my USB Flash drive?](https://www.hirensbootcd.org/howtos/)“** section on our [HOWTOs](https://www.hirensbootcd.org/howtos/ "HOWTOs") page. Next, you can **uncheck** “Format Selected USB Device” option and just keep “Copy ISO Content to USB Device” option checked on ISO2USB.exe for just copying the ISO content to your USB flash drive without formatting or partitioning it.

Please note that; if you check “Format Selected USB Device” option, all data and partitions on your USB flash drive will be lost. Before doing the steps below, don’t forget to backup the files on your USB flash drive:

## Hiren's BootCD PE - ISO2USB v1.1 (x86)

Download [**ISO2USB.exe**](https://www.hirensbootcd.org/files/ISO2USB.exe) to your computer.

## Choose Device and ISO

Only USB flash drives will be listed in the **USB Device** list. If you can’t see your USB flash drive in the list, firstly try formatting your USB flash drive with Windows Format tool (Goto My Computer -> Right Click USB Drive -> Click ‘Format’… -> Click ‘Restore device defaults’ -> Keep ‘Quick Format’ Checked -> Click ‘Start’) and then click the refresh button on the right side of USB Device list.

If the ISO file is located in same folder with the exe, then it will be automatically selected. Otherwise you can drag and drop the ISO file over the application window or you can select the ISO file manually.
