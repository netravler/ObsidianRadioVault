# 33 Rebar Welding Projects for Garden, Barn & Home

You’ve purchased a welder and completed the welding projects it was initially intended for and now wonder what’s next?  Why not start with a few rebar welding projects?

Rebar is readily available at your local home supply store, steel supply store or you can roundup some [scrap](https://welditu.com/welding/projects/where-to-find-scrap-metal/) rebar and recycle it. 

Rebar is an inexpensive material that you can experiment with.

Along with a simple [rebar bender](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0091KHN2S?tag=grayhorsellc-20&linkCode=ogi&th=1&psc=1 "rebar bender") you can create a wide variety of useful welding projects.

This fun hobby can also evolve into a nice side hustle to make extra money selling your creations online, at a craft show or at events.

If you need to figure out what sizes are available for your projects, here’s a handy [rebar size chart](https://upstaterebar.com/docs/UR-Bar-Sizes.pdf) for a reference guide.

I like rebar because it is extremely versatile, easy to weld and has a rustic industrial look to it.  I hope the ideas in this article will inspire you to get started welding with rebar and creating some great projects.
