If it is can you send me the VIN, along with any pictures/videos of the interior engine compartment, rockers wells, and chassis?

Do you have a clean clear title in hand name?

Sorry, I'm one of those people that asks all kinds of questions.  No hurry on all this...

Have a great 4th.

Kind regards,
